Welcome to the volumed suite of tools:

volumed

volumed is the volume control daemon for audiophile mpd boxes.  It has
been specifically built for mpd boxes based on runeaudio, such as
runeaudio, volumio and moode audio.

It provides very responsive asynchronous websocket based control of
volume and mute.  

The current implementation directly supports moodeaudio and hacks have
been provided for standard moode boxes to be able to use volumed.

volumec

This is a simple but powerful volumed client.  It can be run
interactively, as a command line tool, as an interface from a
named-pipe, or as an lirc client daemon .

volume-config-moode
This is a volumed client that provides moode-specific functionality:
specifically updating the moode database whenever volume or mute status
changes.  It also provides dynamic configuration updates to volumed.  It
can be run as a simple command in which case all database-specific
configuration is (re)sent to volumed, or as a deamon in which case it
will listen for status changes and record them to the database.
