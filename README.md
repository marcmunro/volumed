# Volumed

volumed is a websocket-based volume control daemon for audiophile mpd
boxes.  It has been specifically built for mpd boxes based on runeaudio,
such as runeaudio, volumio and moode audio.

It provides a highly responsive asynchronous control mechanism for
managing volume and mute.

It is currently under development.
